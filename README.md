## Crawler

The web crawler can be found in the ```uniloc_crawler``` folder. Within that folder there will be another subfolder with my name. It is necessary to install the ```Scrapy``` framework in Python with the following command:

```bash
pip install scrapy
```

You can run the following command to execute each spider individually and produce the output to the file

```bash
scrapy crawl <spider name> -o.json file
```

## Laravel

The laravel project located in the ```laravel``` folder can be started with the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve --port=3500
```

The .env file contains the configuration parameters for connecting to the MySQL database.

## VueJS

The VueJS project can be found at ```laravel > vue```. To initialize the project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run serves
```
